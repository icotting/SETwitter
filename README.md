Learning Patterns with Twitter
==============

This project contains a set of examples used in my Intro to Software Engineering course. It presents several core patterns including MVC, Unit of Work, Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection, Interceptor, and Proxy. It also exposes students to the same system implemented using several frameworks and languages, including:

* Java EE 7
* ASP.NET MVC with C#
* Javascript with nodeJS and Geddy
* iOS with Objective C
* HTML5 client-side view with Ember on the client nad Express on the server

NOTE: the iOS project uses the Express backend as its server
