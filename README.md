Learning Patterns with Twitter
==============

This project contains a set of examples used in my Intro to Software Engineering course. It presents several core patterns including MVC, Unit of Work, Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection, Interceptor, and Proxy. It also exposes students to the same system implemented using several frameworks and languages, including:

* Java EE 7
* ASP.NET MVC with C#

NOTE: the iOS project uses the Express backend as its server
